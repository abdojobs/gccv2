GPS Cycle Computer GCC

********* version 4.9 *********
- speed up reading files for "Track2Follow"
- speed up reading GPX files and make it compatible to XML syntax (now compatible to GPX files from crossingways)
- in GPX export the track can be separated in segments when logging has gaps (Pause) of more than 10s (enable in Kml/Gpx options)
- when automatic OSM map download is enabled, the visible map tiles can be forced to reload by context menue
- compass in main screen can be configured in different styles (arrow, digital, letter)
- additional log intervals: logging every 5m or 10m (but always every 30s) - settings index has changed, so check your setting if you use "run every x sec"
- reduced flicker on menu page when scrolling (thanks to dokkis)
- update button in About page (thanks to kilblg)
- Navigation commands as text in map screen
- Navigation commands as spoken voice in different languages and voices
- Tracks are no longer restricted to 18 hours
- Restore last session (active tracks). Done automatically after abnormal termination.
- Odometer. You can set your initial ODO in gccState.txt (first line [m]). Don't change anything else!
- Sattelite and Snr is no more blinking if $GPGSV is not sent every second (trusts for 10s)
- foreground and background color can be set in options - main
- file names of current track and t2f are now displayed in options (first page)
- a warning is displayed if you try to continue a track which is more than 1km distant.
- live logging with crossingways and automatic map download is now asynchron (doesn't block application)
- all osm servers are defined in "osm_servers.txt" ("osm_server.txt" is no longer used)
- osm download server are stored for each map separately in corresponding map directory in server.txt
- edit T2F: add points click by click in map screen. Also remove and undo function.
- support for heart rate belt. You need a hardware to feed the heart pulses into the microphone input.
- time in GPX export is now UTC time, as required by GPX specification
- new Format for csv-export in log1.csv


********* version 4.8 *********
new features:
- audio notes in waypoints
- improved calculation of altitude gain (affects also old tracks)
- improved GPX file support to read files from http://openrouteservice.org
- compass in main can be configured to show "north" (device must be held up in direction of movement)
- new Navigation arrow shows direction to follow T2F (100m ahead) - either in map or fullscreen in new navigation screen
- new "About" button in menu page

bugfix:
- at 00:00 UTC time and AVG > 1, a wrong point far away was logged


********* version 4.7 *********
new features:
- press stop: -> GPS is switched off
- recall settings: -> name is displayed in Info field
- initialization of GPS device by \GccInitGps.txt possible
- hide map

bugfixes:
- back and fore color of "Distance to T2F"

********* version 4.6 SP1 *********
- input Lat Lon accepts lowercase for N/S E/W and also O alternative to E (East = Ost in German)
bugfix:
- "exclude stop time" works as before (4.5) because of incorrect average speed and trip time when track loaded back.

********* version 4.6 *********
new features:
- Waypoint support for GCC and GPX files. Display Waypoints - position and name - on the map screen
- Distance on the main screen with the new options in the context menu: 
  * distance trip
  * distance to start/end of track to follow or (air line distance, not real track line distance)
- Checkpoint renamed to waypoint in the GUI
- if the track log is stopped (or loaded from disk), and the start log button is pressed again,
  the user is now asked, if he want´s to continue logging into the existing log file.
- Lat Lon display and Input LatLon is now very flexible: deg [min [sec]] with or without decimal digits, signed or N/S E/W
- display of altitude max and min (alternatively to gain, loss, slope).
  "delta" has been removed as it is the same as "relative" in the upper field.
- track line can be hidden ("hide track" in context menu)
  
bugfixes:
- if the distance between track2follow and current position is displayed, it may be overwritten by the current track line
- if the "exclude stop time" option is selected, the stop time is not included in the track log and live logging.
- if map folders are available for several zoom levels, but some map tiles are missing, the best map was not in any case used
- "Clear Track" now clears all data

********* version 4.5 *********
new features:
- if track2follow and current position can´t be displayed on the same screen: 
  * an additional line indicates the shortest way
  * the distance between T2F and current position is shown
- New context menu on the map screen:
  * show the start / end position of the track to follow, 
  * add an check point (only if logging is active)
  * reset map to current position
- new energy safe options 
  * switch GPS off during power off (tracklog will be interrupted, a popup will inform the user)
  * switch Backlight off after timeout
- if a track log is activated, and in the file dialog the cancel button is pressed, logging is not started.
- Input Lat/Long can now additionally be used, to navigate to a specific point (e.g. usefull for Geocaching)
- in map screen: arrow now in color of track line (configurable)

bugfixes:
- Bugifx Recall Buttons naming and safe configuration now working on Windows Mobile 6.5 / HTC TD2
- Improved text output on the settings-option page (after changing the map file location, and recall a configuration, the wrong
  map file path was displayed)
- Improved compatibility of GPX file format. Newlines added
