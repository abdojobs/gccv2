GPS Cycle Computer GCC
********* version 4.6 *********
new features:
- Waypoint support for GCC and GPX files. Display Waypoints - position and name - on the map screen
- Distance on the main screen with the new options in the context menu: 
  * distance trip
  * distance to start/end of track to follow or (air line distance, not real track line distance)
- Checkpoint renamed to waypoint in the GUI
- if the track log is stopped (or loaded from disk), and the start log button is pressed again, 
  the user is now asked, if he want´s to continue logging into the existing log file. 
  
bugfixes:
- if the distance between track2follow and current position is displayed, it may be overwritten by the current track line
- if the "exclude stop time" option is selected, the stop time is not included in the track log and live logging.
- if map folders are available for several zoom levels, but some map tiles are missing, the best map was not
  in any case used 

********* version 4.5 *********
new features:
- if track2follow and current position can´t be displayed on the same screen: 
  * an additional line indicates the shortest way
  * the distance between T2F and current position is shown
- New context menu on the map screen:
  * show the start / end position of the track to follow, 
  * add an check point (only if logging is active)
  * reset map to current position
- new energy safe options 
  * switch GPS off during power off (tracklog will be interrupted, a popup will inform the user)
  * switch Backlight off after timeout
- if a track log is activated, and in the file dialog the cancel button is pressed, logging is not started.
- Input Lat/Long can now additionally be used, to navigate to a specific point (e.g. usefull for Geocaching)
- in map screen: arrow now in color of track line (configurable)

bugfixes:
- Bugifx Recall Buttons naming and safe configuration now working on Windows Mobile 6.5 / HTC TD2
- Improved text output on the settings-option page (after changing the map file location, and recall a configuration, the wrong
  map file path was displayed)
- Improved compatibility of GPX file format. Newlines added

- slope calculation and display in %
- log of raw NMEA (only for developers and serious tester)

improvements:
- calculation of Elevation Gain
- calculation of Stoppage Time
- averaging (smoothing) of speed
- displaying of (osm)map with missing zoom levels
- shift menu page

- corrected: GPX upload to crossingways
- GPS driver enhanced
- OSM style Map mode now supports besides .png other file types like .jpg .bmp .gif .exif .tiff
