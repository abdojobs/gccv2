 - input Lat Lon
 - Lap function
 - Graph versus distance (not only time)

- modified autoscale algorithm to have osm zoom levels < 18
- modified satellites in view
- modified altitude reading, should now work better with windows GPS driver; additional option WGS84 altitude
- corrected: GPX upload to crossingways
- GPS driver enhanced
- OSM style Map mode now supports besides .png other file types like .jpg .bmp .gif .exif .tiff
- minor improvements and bug fixes
